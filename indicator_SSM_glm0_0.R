# Preliminary R scripts for genetic indicator testing projects
# to analyze relationship between genetic indicators and 
# species characteristics in species selection matrix (SSM)
#
# Generalized linear model (GLM) is used for the analysis
# (other types of models will be provided in other scripts)
#
# I provide three methods to quantify variable importances;
# 1. statistical significance in GLM
# 2. model selection by stepAIC (the variables selected by this process is meaningful to explain the diffirences in indicator values)
# 3. randomization by using package biomod2 (see https://rdrr.io/rforge/biomod2/man/variables_importance.html)
#
# required future improvements;
# need codes to cleanup data especially in SSM
# consider to include interaction terms between explanatory variables in the model

# include strings in the data (e.g. "less than 0.01"), 
# they are treated as categorical varialbes ignoring the order (i.e."0.01-0.1"<"0.1-1"<"1-10") among categories
# to use these quantitative characteristics as continuous variable, 
# we need conversion such as "0.01-0.1" -> 0.01 (as.numeric).
