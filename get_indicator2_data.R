###
### This R function takes as input the output of the Kobo form "International Genetic Indicator testing" 
### and reformat its in order to have the data in a dataframe useful for estimating 
### Genetic Diversity Indicator 2 (the proportion of populations within species which are maintained)
###

get_indicator2_data<-function(kobo_output=kobo_output){

### Arguments:
  
  # kobo_output = a data frame object read into R from the `.csv` file 
  # resulting from exporting the Kobotoolbox data from the form 
  # "International Genetic Indicator testing" wit the settings explaiend at
  # https://github.com/AliciaMstt/GeneticIndicators
  
### Needed libraries:  
  
#  library(tidyr)
#  library(dplyr)
#  library(utile.tools)
#  library(stringr)
