This notebook estimates the indicators based on the raw clean data and perfomrs the main analyses and figures used in the manuscript of the multicountry paper. The input is the "clean kobo output" that was first cleaned by `2_cleaning.Rmd`. Besides the plots and statistics shown below, the output is are the indicators data ready to be used to estimate the indicators (`ind[1-3]_data.csv`), a single file with the indicators already calculated (`indicators_full.csv`) and metadata.

## Get data 

Get indicators and metadata data from clean kobo output
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Get data:
kobo_clean<-read.csv(file="kobo_output_clean.csv", header=TRUE)

# Extract indicator 1 data from kobo output, show most relevant columns
ind1_data<-get_indicator1_data(kobo_output=kobo_clean)
head(ind1_data[,c(1:3, 12:14)])

# Extract Proportion of maintained populations (indicator) data from kobo output, show most relevant columns
ind2_data<-get_indicator2_data(kobo_output=kobo_clean)
head(ind2_data[,c(1:3, 9:10,13)])

# Extract indicator 3 data from kobo output, show most relevant columns
ind3_data<-get_indicator3_data(kobo_output=kobo_clean)
head(ind3_data[,c(1:3, 9:11)])

# extract metadata, show most relevant columns
metadata<-get_metadata(kobo_output=kobo_clean)
head(metadata[,c(1:3, 12, 25,26, 64)])
```

Get population data for those species assessed using the tabular text template instead of Kobo. This file was produced by the script `1.2_cleaning.Rmd`
```{r}
ind1_data_from_templates<-read.csv(file="ind1_data_from_templates.csv")

```

Add data recorded using the population template to the ind1_data already in the nice format.
```{r}
ind1_data<-rbind(ind1_data, ind1_data_from_templates)
```


## Estimate indicators

### Indicator 1 or Ne 500 indicator (proportion of populations with Ne >500):

Show most relevant columns of indicator 1 data
```{r}
ind1_data %>% select(country_assessment, taxon, population, Name, Ne, NeLower, NeUpper, NeYear, GeneticMarkers, NcType, NcMethod, NcRange)

```

Remember what the function to transform NcRange and NcPoint data into Ne does:
```{r}
# check what the custom funciton does
transform_to_Ne
```

Use function to get Ne data from NcRange or NcPoint data, and their combination (Ne estimated from Ne if Ne is available, otherwise, from Nc)

```{r}
ind1_data<-transform_to_Ne(ind1_data = ind1_data, ratio = 0.1)
```

Check transformation in example:
```{r}
ind1_data %>% select(country_assessment, taxon, population, Name, Ne, NeLower, NeUpper, NeYear, GeneticMarkers, NcType, NcMethod, NcRange, Nc_from_range, Ne_from_Nc, Ne_combined)
```


Remember what the function to estimate indicator 1 does:
```{r}
# check what the custom function does
estimate_indicator1
```

**Now estimate indicator 1 :)**

```{r}
indicator1<-estimate_indicator1(ind1_data = ind1_data)
```

Check example data:
```{r}
indicator1 %>% select(X_uuid, taxon, country_assessment, n_pops, n_pops_Ne_data, n_pops_more_500, indicator1)
```


### Indicator 2 or PM indicator: proportion of populations within species which are maintained.

Show most relevant columns of indicator 2 data:
```{r}
ind2_data %>% select(country_assessment, taxon, n_extant_populations, n_extint_populations)

```


Proportion of maintained populations (indicator) is the he proportion of populations within species which are maintained. This can be estimated based on the `n_extant_populations` and `n_extint_populations`, as follows:

```{r}
ind2_data$indicator2<- ind2_data$n_extant_populations / (ind2_data$n_extant_populations + ind2_data$n_extint_populations)
```

Example output selecting the most relevant columns:

```{r}
ind2_data %>% select(country_assessment, taxon, n_extant_populations, n_extint_populations, indicator2)
```


### Indicator 3 or genetic monitoring indicator: number of species with genetic diversity monitoring

Example of indicator 3 data selecting the most relevant columns:
```{r}
ind3_data %>% select(country_assessment, taxon, multiassessment, temp_gen_monitoring, gen_studies, gen_monitoring_years, source_genetic_studies)
```



Indicator 3 refers to the number (count) of taxa by country in which genetic monitoring is occurring. This is stored in the variable `temp_gen_monitoring` as a "yes/no" answer for each taxon, so to estimate the indicator, we only need to count how many said "yes", keeping only one of the records when the taxon was multiassessed.

```{r}
indicator3<-ind3_data %>%
                 # keep only one record if the taxon was assessed more than once within the country
                 select(country_assessment, taxon, temp_gen_monitoring) %>%
                 filter(!duplicated(.)) %>%

                 # count "yes" in tem_gen_monitoring by country
                 filter(temp_gen_monitoring=="yes") %>%
                 group_by(country_assessment) %>%
                 summarise(n_taxon_gen_monitoring= n())
```

Example output:

```{r}
indicator3
```



### Join indicators and metadata in a single table

It could be useful to have the PM and Ne 500 indicators and the metadata in a single large table.
```{r}
indicators_full<-left_join(metadata, indicator1) %>% 
                     left_join(ind2_data)
```

### Check number of rows of each object, i.e. n including alternative assessments
```{r}
# Number of populations inc alternative assessments
nrow(ind1_data)

# Number of assessments including multiassessments (these 3 objects should have the same number of rows)
nrow(indicators_full)
nrow(ind2_data)
nrow(ind3_data)
nrow(metadata)


```

### Save indicators data
Save indicators data and metadata to csv files, useful for analyses outside R.

```{r}
# save processed data
write.csv(ind1_data, "ind1_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
write.csv(indicators_full, "indicators_full.csv", row.names = FALSE)
write.csv(ind2_data, "ind2_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
write.csv(ind3_data, "ind3_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
write.csv(metadata, "metadata.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```


## Change country name to nicer labels

To have nice levels in the plots we will change the way country names are written: 

```{r nice country names}
# make factor
metadata$country_assessment<-as.factor(metadata$country_assessment)
indicators_full$country_assessment<-as.factor(indicators_full$country_assessment)
ind2_data$country_assessment<-as.factor(ind2_data$country_assessment)
ind1_data$country_assessment<-as.factor(ind1_data$country_assessment)
indicator1$country_assessment<-as.factor(indicator1$country_assessment)

# original levels
levels(metadata$country_assessment)

# change
levels(metadata$country_assessment)<-c("Australia", "Belgium", "Colombia", "France", "Japan", "Mexico", "South Africa", "Sweden", "USA")
levels(indicators_full$country_assessment)<-c("Australia", "Belgium", "Colombia", "France", "Japan", "Mexico", "South Africa", "Sweden", "USA")
levels(ind1_data$country_assessment)<-c("Australia", "Belgium", "Colombia", "France", "Japan", "Mexico", "South Africa", "Sweden", "USA")
levels(ind2_data$country_assessment)<-c("Australia", "Belgium", "Colombia", "France", "Japan", "Mexico", "South Africa", "Sweden", "USA")
levels(indicator1$country_assessment)<-c("Australia", "Belgium", "Colombia", "France", "Japan", "Mexico", "South Africa", "Sweden", "USA")


```


## Simplify combinations of methods to define populations

The methods used to define populations come from a check box question were one or more of the following categories can be selected: genetic_clusters, geographic_boundaries, eco_biogeo_proxies, adaptive_traits, management_units, other. As a consequence any combination of the former can be possible. Leading to the following frequency table:

```{r}
table(indicators_full$defined_populations)
```

It is hard to group the above methods, so we will keep the original groups with n >=19 in the above list, and tag the combinations that appear few times as as "other_combinations".

Which groups have n>=19?
```{r}
x<-as.data.frame(table(indicators_full$defined_populations)[table(indicators_full$defined_populations) >= 19])
colnames(x)[1]<-"method"

x

```

We can add this new column to the metadata and indicator data:

```{r} 
### for indicators 
indicators_full<- indicators_full %>% 
  mutate(defined_populations_simplified = case_when(
         # if the method is in the list of methods n>=19 then keep it
         defined_populations %in% x$method ~ defined_populations,
         TRUE ~ "other_combinations"))


### for meta
metadata<- metadata %>% 
  mutate(defined_populations_simplified = case_when(
         # if the method is in the list of methods n>=19 then keep it
         defined_populations %in% x$method ~ defined_populations,
         TRUE ~ "other_combinations"))

### for ind1 raw data
ind1_data<- ind1_data %>% 
  mutate(defined_populations_simplified = case_when(
         # if the method is in the list of methods n>=19 then keep it
         defined_populations %in% x$method ~ defined_populations,
         TRUE ~ "other_combinations"))
         
```


Check n for simplified methods:

```{r}
table(indicators_full$defined_populations_simplified)
```

Table of equivalences:

```{r}
indicators_full %>% 
       select(defined_populations, defined_populations_simplified) %>% 
       filter(!duplicated(defined_populations))
```

Create nicer names for ploting
```{r}
# original method names
levels(as.factor(indicators_full$defined_populations_simplified))


# nicer names
nice_names <- c("dispersal buffer",
                "eco- biogeographic proxies",
                 "genetic clusters",
                 "genetic clusters & eco- biogeographic proxies",
                 "genetic clusters & geographic boundaries",
                 "geographic boundaries",
                 "geographic boundaries & eco- biogeographic proxies",
                 "geographic boundaries & management units",
                 "management units",
                 "other", 
                 "other combinations")


### add them
indicators_full$defined_populations_nicenames <- factor(
    indicators_full$defined_populations_simplified,
    levels = levels(as.factor(indicators_full$defined_populations_simplified)),
    labels = nice_names)

# metadata
metadata$defined_populations_nicenames <- factor(
    metadata$defined_populations_simplified,
    levels = levels(as.factor(metadata$defined_populations_simplified)),
    labels = nice_names)

#check names match
select(metadata, defined_populations_nicenames, defined_populations_simplified)
levels(indicators_full$defined_populations_nicenames)
```



## Averaging multiassessments (alternative assessments)
Some taxa were assessed twice or more times, for example to account for uncertainty on how to divide populations. This information is stored in variable `multiassessment` of the metadata (created by `get_metadata()`). An example of taxa with multiple assessments:

```{r}
metadata %>%
filter(multiassessment=="multiassessment")  %>%
  select(taxonomic_group, taxon, country_assessment, multiassessment) %>%
  arrange(taxon, country_assessment) %>%
  head()
  
```

Alternative assessments allow to account for uncertainty in the number of populations or the size of them. We can examine how the indicators value species by species as done elsewhere in these analyses (see below "Values for indicator 1 and 2 for multiassessed species), but to examine global trends, some of the figures below use the average. **The averages are stored in a different column, labeled `indicator[1 or 2]_mean`.**

```{r}
indicators_averaged<-indicators_full %>%
  # group desired multiassessments
  group_by(country_assessment, multiassessment, taxon) %>%
  # estimate means
  mutate(indicator1_mean=mean(indicator1, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(indicator2_mean=mean(indicator2, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  # change NaN for NA (needed due to the NAs and 0s in the dataset)
  mutate_all(~ifelse(is.nan(.), NA, .)) 
```

Examples of how this looks to check it was done properly. For indicator 1:

A species assessed in different countries (Sweden and Belgium), with alternative assessment within Sweden. The average is computed only for the Swedish assessments
```{r}

indicators_averaged %>%
  filter(taxon == "Barbastella barbastellus") %>%
  select(taxon, country_assessment, multiassessment, indicator1, indicator1_mean)


```
Alternative assessments within a single country:
```{r}
indicators_averaged %>%
  filter(taxon == "Rana dalmatina") %>%
  select(taxon, country_assessment, multiassessment, indicator1, indicator1_mean, indicator2, indicator2_mean)

indicators_averaged %>%
  filter(taxon == "Notophthalmus perstriatus") %>%
  select(taxon, country_assessment, multiassessment,  indicator1, indicator1_mean, indicator2, indicator2_mean)

```

If one of the alternative assessments has NA, it is removed from the mean calculation, so that the average equals the value of the assessment that has data:
```{r}
indicators_averaged %>%
  filter(taxon == "Alouatta palliata mexicana") %>%
  select(taxon, country_assessment, multiassessment,  indicator1, indicator1_mean, indicator2, indicator2_mean)
```

A species can have alternative assessments for both indicators:
```{r}
indicators_averaged %>%
  filter(taxon == "Aphelocoma coerulescens") %>%
  select(taxon, country_assessment, multiassessment, indicator1, indicator1_mean, indicator2, indicator2_mean)

```


Because we will use the averages to show a single value for multiasssessed taxa, we can keep only the first record for multiassessed taxa.
```{r}
indicators_averaged_one<-indicators_averaged[!duplicated(cbind(indicators_averaged$taxon, indicators_averaged$country_assessment)), ]

```


Example of how this looks:
```{r}
indicators_averaged_one %>%
  filter(taxon == "Aphelocoma coerulescens") %>%
  select(taxon, country_assessment, multiassessment, indicator2, indicator2_mean, indicator1, indicator1_mean)


indicators_averaged_one %>%
  filter(taxon == "Rana dalmatina") %>%
  select(taxon, country_assessment, multiassessment, indicator2, indicator2_mean, indicator1, indicator1_mean)


indicators_averaged_one %>%
  filter(taxon == "Notophthalmus perstriatus") %>%
  select(taxon, country_assessment, multiassessment, indicator2, indicator2_mean, indicator1, indicator1_mean)

```

Total number of taxa (ie assessments averaging alternative assessments):
```{r}
nrow(indicators_averaged_one)
```


## General description of records and taxa assessed by country

Records by country, including taxa assessed more than once (see below for details on this)

```{r  taxa by country, out.width="700px", out.height="400px"}
ggplot(metadata, aes(x=country_assessment)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "count") +
  xlab("") +
  ggtitle("Number of taxa assessed by country, including taxa assed more than once") +
  theme_light()

```

To explore what kind of taxa countries assessed regardless of if they assessed them once or more, we are going to use the subset `indicators_averaged_one`, were we averaged the indicators and kept only 1 record per assessment. 

How many taxa were assessed (i.e. counting only once taxa that were assessed multiple times)?
```{r}
# how many?
nrow(indicators_averaged_one)
```

Plot taxa assessed excluding duplicates, i.e. the real number of taxa assessed:

```{r, out.width="700px", out.height="400px"}
p1<-ggplot(indicators_averaged_one, aes(x=country_assessment)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "count") +
  xlab("") +
  ggtitle("Number of taxa assessed by country") +
  theme_light()
p1

```

Of which countries and taxonomic groups are the taxa that were assessed more than once?
```{r multiassessed}
p2<- indicators_averaged_one %>% # we use the _unique dataset so that multiassesed records are counted only once
        filter(multiassessment=="multiassessment") %>%

ggplot(aes(x=taxonomic_group, fill=country_assessment)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "count") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) +
  labs(fill="Country") +
  xlab("") +
  ggtitle("Number of taxa assessed more than once") +
  theme_light()

p2
```


Total number of taxon with alternative assessments:
```{r}
nrow(indicators_averaged_one %>% filter(multiassessment == "multiassessment"))
```

Number of alternative assessments:
```{r}
nrow(indicators_averaged%>% filter(multiassessment == "multiassessment"))
```


How many alternative assessments there are per multiassessed taxon?
```{r}
x<-indicators_averaged %>% select(country_assessment, multiassessment, taxon) %>%
                         filter(multiassessment == "multiassessment") %>%
                        group_by(taxon)  %>%
                        summarise(n=n())

kable(x)

mean(x$n)
sd(x$n)
median(x$n)
```

### Supplementary Figure S1: Number of species and multiassessed species per country

```{r}
plot_grid(p1 + ggtitle(""),
          p2 + ggtitle(""), ncol = 1, labels = c("A)", "B)"))

ggsave("FigS1.pdf", width = 20, height = 24  , units = "cm")

```


### Heatmap of the taxa assessed by country (counting multiassessments only once)

We aimed to represent different taxonomic groups within animals (amphibians, birds, fishes, invertebrates, mammals and reptiles), plants (angiosperms, bryophytes, gymnosperms and pteridophytes), fungi and others (e.g. lichens). Order levels to represent those categories:

```{r}
indicators_averaged_one$taxonomic_group<- factor(indicators_averaged_one$taxonomic_group,
                                                 levels = c("amphibian", "bird", "fish", "invertebrate", "mammal", "reptile", "angiosperm", "bryophyte", "gymnosperm", "pteridophytes", "fungus", "other"))
```

Make a heatmap

```{r}

## Agregate data to get counts 

agg_data <- indicators_averaged_one %>% # we use the _unique dataset so that multiassesed records are counted only once
        filter(multiassessment!="multiassessment") %>%
        group_by(country_assessment, taxonomic_group) %>%
        summarize(count = n())

# country names in desired order
agg_data$country_assessment <- factor(agg_data$country_assessment, 
                                      levels = rev(levels(agg_data$country_assessment)))
  
  
## Create a heat map
p_heat<- ggplot(agg_data, aes(x = taxonomic_group, y = country_assessment, fill = count)) + 
  geom_tile() + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightblue", high = "darkblue") +  # Adjust color scale as needed
  labs(x = "",
    y = "",
    fill = "Number of taxa"
  ) + 
  scale_x_discrete(position = "top") +
  theme_light() + 
  theme(panel.border = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 0),
    legend.position = "right", text = element_text(size = 13),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # remove background
  )
p_heat
  
```




## Population size data (Has Nc or Ne? what type of Nc?)

Transform NAs to insuff_data_species, since effectively they are the same:

```{r}
# check NAs
summary(as.factor(metadata$popsize_data))


# Replace NA to insuff_data_species
metadata <-metadata %>% 
           mutate(popsize_data=replace_na(popsize_data, "insuff_data_species"))

# check
summary(as.factor(metadata$popsize_data))
```

Re-order  popsize_data to have inssuficient data at the end in the plots
```{r}
metadata$popsize_data<-factor(metadata$popsize_data, 
                              levels= c("insuff_data_species", "data_for_species","yes"))

```



### Supplementary Figure S5: Population size data availability by country

Countries have population size data (Nc or Ne) regardless of the taxonomic group. The last panel includes the entire dataset:

```{r}

## Number of populations with Ne < 50 from genetic or NcPoint data

The more worrying threshold, where the effects of inbreeding become more pronounced in the short-term (more immediate risk of extinction), occurs at Ne < 50. We cannot estimate how many populations are below this threshold from all our data, since the NcRange variable includes qualitative range data (eg. "less 5000 by much") that we can translate into more/less than Ne 500, but not Ne 50. 

Therefore to count how many populations are Ne < 50 we first selected the populations with Ne or NcPoint data:

```{r}
forNe50<- ind1_data %>%
          # keep only rows without missing data in Ne or NcPoint
          filter(!is.na(Ne) | !is.na(NcPoint)) %>%
          # keep more relevant variables:
          select(country_assessment, taxon, Ne, MethodNe, NcPoint, NcRange, Ne_from_Nc, Ne_calculated_from, Ne_combined)

forNe50

```

Total number of populations with Ne or Nc_point data:
```{r}
nrow(forNe50)
```


We then can count how many of them are below Ne 50:
```{r}
# select pops Ne_combined (coming from either Ne genetic or NePoint converted with the ratio)
Neless50<- forNe50  %>% filter(Ne_combined < 50)

# how many?
nrow(Neless50)

# % of the the total number of pops with Ne or Nc_point data:
round(nrow(Neless50) / nrow(forNe50) * 100)
```

Check by origin of the Nc data
```{r}
Neless50 %>% ggplot(aes(x=Ne_combined, fill=Ne_calculated_from)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha=0.6, position = 'identity') + theme_light()
  
```


## Missing data on extant and extinct populations

We have NA in Proportion of maintained populations (indicator) because in some cases the number of extinct populations is unknown, therefore the operation cannot be computed. 

### Counts
Total records with NA in extant populations:
```{r}
sum(is.na(indicators_full$n_extant_populations))
```

Taxa with NA in extant populations:
```{r}
indicators_full %>%
  filter(is.na(n_extant_populations)) %>%
    select(country_assessment, taxonomic_group, taxon, n_extant_populations, n_extint_populations)
```

Total taxa with NA in **extinct** populations:
```{r}
sum(is.na(indicators_full$n_extint_populations))
```

Do taxa with NA for extant also have NA for extinct?

```{r}
indicators_full$taxon[is.na(indicators_full$n_extant_populations)] %in% indicators_full$taxon[is.na(indicators_full$n_extint_populations)]
```

So out of the `r nrow(indicators_full)`, we have **`r sum(is.na(indicators_full$n_extint_populations))` records with NA in n_extinct** and **`r sum(is.na(indicators_full$n_extant_populations))` records with NA in n_extant**. Of them, `r sum(indicators_full$taxon[is.na(indicators_full$n_extant_populations)] %in% indicators_full$taxon[is.na(indicators_full$n_extint_populations)])` have NA in both n_extant and n_extinct.


### Plot missing data extinct populations

## Exploratory plots for the association of distribution range (restricted vs wide) on the indicators

All the following plots and analyses consider the average of multiassessed species (variable `_mean`), so that they are shown only once.

To have nicer looking plots, change "wide_ranging" for "wide ranging":
```{r}
indicators_averaged_one$species_range<-gsub("wide_ranging", "wide ranging", indicators_averaged_one$species_range)
```

## Statistical models: test for associations between method used to define populations / range type on the number of populations and the indicator values

The analyses and plots below us a subset of data filtering outliers (>500 populations) and using the simplified methods (see above). Multiassessed species are considered independently (each assessment is a data point).

### (a) Does the number of maintained pops vary with method used? 

First we tested whether the different methods reported in this study were associated with varying numbers of populations obtained. For this analysis, we also controlled for range type, as we expect species with wider ranges to plausibly have more populations than species with narrower ranges.

Plot number of populations by method.
```{r, out.height="500px", out.width="1064px"}
# Prepare data for plot with nice labels:
# sample size of TOTAL populations
sample_size <- indicators_full %>%
                    filter(!is.na(n_extant_populations)) %>% 
                    filter(n_extant_populations<500) %>%
                    group_by(defined_populations_nicenames) %>% summarize(num=n())

# custom axis
## new dataframe
df<-indicators_full %>% 
  filter(!is.na(n_extant_populations)) %>% 
  filter(n_extant_populations<500) %>%
    # add sampling size 
  left_join(sample_size) %>%
  mutate(myaxis = paste0(defined_populations_nicenames, " (n= ", num, ")")) %>%
#myaxis needs levels in the same order than defined_populations_nicenames
  mutate(myaxis = factor(myaxis, 
                  levels=levels(as.factor(myaxis))[c(1,12,2:11,13)])) # reorders levels


# plot for number of pops
  pa<- df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=myaxis, y=n_extant_populations, color=defined_populations_nicenames,
                                               fill=defined_populations_nicenames)) +
          geom_boxplot() + xlab("") + ylab("Number of maintained populations") +
          geom_jitter(size=.4, width = 0.1, color="black") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_light() +
  theme(panel.border = element_blank(), legend.position="none",
        plot.margin = unit(c(0, 0, 0, 0), "cm")) + # this is used to decrease the space between plots
  scale_color_manual(values=simplifiedmethods_colors,
                    breaks=levels(as.factor(indicators_full$defined_populations_nicenames))) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=alpha(simplifiedmethods_colors, 0.3),
                    breaks=levels(as.factor(indicators_full$defined_populations_nicenames))) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits=rev) +  
  theme(text = element_text(size = 13))
pa

```

Prepare data for model (remove outliers, "unknown" category and NA in desired variable) and check n:
```{r}
# remove missing data 
data_for_model<-indicators_full %>% 
                      filter(!is.na(n_extant_populations)) %>%
                      filter(species_range !="unknown") %>% # we remove "unknonw" because its n is too low, thus unbalancing the model
                      filter(n_extant_populations<500) # doesn't make a difference in the test below, but useful for plots

# check n per method
table(data_for_model$defined_populations_simplified)

# total n
nrow(data_for_model)

# re-level to use geographic boundaries as reference category for the analysis
data_for_model$defined_populations_simplified<-relevel(as.factor(data_for_model$defined_populations_simplified),
                                                       ref="geographic_boundaries")

# make sure specis range is a factor
data_for_model$species_range<-as.factor(data_for_model$species_range)

```

Run model asking: Does the number of maintained pops vary with method and range?

```{r}
m.a1<-glmer(data_for_model$n_extant_populations ~ data_for_model$defined_populations_simplified + data_for_model$species_range + (1|data_for_model$country_assessment), family ="poisson")

summary(m.a1)
```

Considering the role of method was so important for determining the number of populations, we also tested whether this effect remained after removing “wide-ranging” from the model. The objective here was to test whether method alone would also produce varying numbers of populations, for example if species rangedness were unknown.

Does the number of maintained pops vary with method used? (does method still influence number of populations if we exclude range type from the model):

```{r}
m.a2<-glmer(data_for_model$n_extant_populations ~ data_for_model$defined_populations_simplified + 
            (1|data_for_model$country_assessment), family ="poisson")
```

See results:
```{r}
summary(m.a2)
```

Extending from this result, we also tested whether species range alone is an important predictor of the number of extant populations, as species range is determined by the geographic spread of the species, but not necessarily fragmentation

Does the number of maintained pops vary with range?
```{r}
m.a3<-glmer(n_extant_populations ~ species_range + (1|country_assessment), family = "poisson", data = data_for_model)

summary(m.a3)
```



### (b) Does the proportion of maintained populations (indicator2) vary with method used to define populations?

Our next goal was to determine whether study design (i.e. clustering method to define populations) and/or species-level variables (number of populations, range type) appropriately were associated with the measurement of the genetic indicators. 


Plot PM indicator by method to define populations:

```{r}
# Prepare data for plot with nice labels:
# sample size of TOTAL populations
sample_size <- indicators_full %>%
                    filter(!is.na(indicator2)) %>% 
                    filter(n_extant_populations<500) %>% 
                    group_by(defined_populations_nicenames) %>% summarize(num=n())

# custom axis
## new dataframe
df<-indicators_full %>% 
  filter(n_extant_populations<500) %>%
  filter(!is.na(indicator2)) %>% 
    # add sampling size 
  left_join(sample_size) %>%
  mutate(myaxis = paste0(defined_populations_nicenames, " (n= ", num, ")")) %>%
#myaxis needs levels in the same order than defined_populations_nicenames
  mutate(myaxis = factor(myaxis, 
                  levels=levels(as.factor(myaxis))[c(1,12,2:11,13)])) # reorders levels



## plot for Proportion of maintained populations (indicator)
pb<- df %>%
  filter(n_extant_populations<500) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=myaxis, y=indicator2, color=defined_populations_nicenames,    
                                     fill=defined_populations_nicenames)) +
          geom_boxplot() + xlab("") + ylab("Proportion of maintained populations within species") +
          geom_jitter(size=.4, width = 0.1, color="black") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_light() +
  theme(panel.border = element_blank(), legend.position="none",
        plot.margin = unit(c(0, 0, 0, 0), "cm")) + # this is used to decrease the space between plots) 
  scale_fill_manual(values=alpha(simplifiedmethods_colors, 0.3),
                    breaks=levels(as.factor(indicators_full$defined_populations_nicenames))) +
  scale_color_manual(values=simplifiedmethods_colors,
                    breaks=levels(as.factor(indicators_full$defined_populations_nicenames))) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits=rev) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 13))
pb

```

Plot Scatter plot of indicator2 vs extant pops
```{r}
psupA<- indicators_full %>%
  # filter outliers with too many pops and missing data
  filter(n_extant_populations<500) %>%
  filter(!is.na(indicator2)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(n_extant_populations)) %>%
  filter(species_range !="unknown") %>%
  
  # plot
    ggplot(aes(x=n_extant_populations, y=indicator2, color=defined_populations_nicenames)) +
    geom_point() +
    theme_light() +
    scale_color_manual(values=simplifiedmethods_colors,
                    breaks=levels(as.factor(indicators_full$defined_populations_nicenames))) +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    ylab("Proportion of maintained populations within species") +
    xlab("Number of maintained populations") +
    theme(text = element_text(size = 13))
psupA

psupA.1<- indicators_full %>%
  # filter outliers with too many pops and missing data
  filter(n_extant_populations<500) %>%
  filter(!is.na(indicator2)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(n_extant_populations)) %>%
  filter(species_range !="unknown") %>%
  
  # plot
    ggplot(aes(x=n_extant_populations, y=indicator2, color=species_range)) +
    geom_point() +
    theme_light() +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    ylab("Proportion of maintained populations within species") +
    xlab("Number of maintained populations") +
    theme(text = element_text(size = 13))
psupA.1

```

First we want to test if the Proportion of maintained populations (indicator 2) vary with method used.

Prepare data for model (remove outliers and NA in desired variable) and check n:
```{r}
# remove missing data 
data_for_model<-indicators_full %>% 
                      filter(!is.na(indicator2)) %>%
                      filter(n_extant_populations<500) # doesn't make a difference in the test below, but useful for plots

# check n per method
table(data_for_model$defined_populations_simplified)

# total n
nrow(data_for_model)

# re-level to use geographic boundaries as reference category for the analysis
data_for_model$defined_populations_simplified<-relevel(as.factor(data_for_model$defined_populations_simplified),
                                                       ref="geographic_boundaries")

```

Run model asking: Does Proportion of maintained populations (indicator 2) vary with method used? Controlling for variation in indicator2 among countries:


```{r}
m.b1<-glmmTMB(indicator2 ~ defined_populations_simplified + (1|country_assessment), family = "ordbeta", data = data_for_model)
```

See results:
```{r}
summary(m.b1)
```

Given the preceding relationships detected between method, number of populations, and species’ range, we investigated associations between these variables and our indicator values in more detail, to aid in understanding the underlying mechanisms that were driving the association between method (especially genetic clusters) and indicator 2. That is, we hypothesised that the relationship between method and indicator 2 may be an indirect result of the association between method and number of populations and species range. 

First we added number of populations to our model testing the relationship between method and indicator 2

```{r}
m.b2<-glmmTMB(indicator2 ~ defined_populations_simplified + n_extant_populations + (1|country_assessment), family = "ordbeta", data = data_for_model)

summary(m.b2)
```

Then we tested (see plot psupA) if there is a relationship between number of maintained populations and the PM indicator, overall, and/or with some methods?

Prepare data for model (remove outliers and NA in desired variable) and check n:
```{r}
# remove missing data 
data_for_model<-indicators_full %>% 
                      filter(!is.na(indicator2)) %>%
                      filter(!is.na(n_extant_populations)) %>%
                      filter(n_extant_populations<500) # doesn't make a difference in the test below, but useful for plots

# check number of methods
length(unique(data_for_model$defined_populations_simplified))

# check n per method
table(data_for_model$defined_populations_simplified)

# total n
nrow(data_for_model)

# re-level to use geographic boundaries as reference category for the analysis
data_for_model$defined_populations_simplified<-relevel(as.factor(data_for_model$defined_populations_simplified),
                                                       ref="geographic_boundaries")

```

We tested for a relationship between number of populations alone with indicator 2 in our dataset (i.e. when not controlling for method). 

Does number of populations alone affect indicator2 (i.e. not controlling for method)?:

```{r}
msupA1 <- glmmTMB(indicator2 ~ n_extant_populations + (1|country_assessment), family = "ordbeta", data= data_for_model)

```

Summary:
```{r}
summary(msupA1)
```

But, there were statistically significant interactions between number of populations and some of the methods used, on indicator 2. 

Does the effect of method on indicator2 depend on number of maintained pops?

```{r}
# run model
msupA2 <- glmmTMB(indicator2 ~ defined_populations_simplified + n_extant_populations + defined_populations_simplified*n_extant_populations + (1|country_assessment), family = "ordbeta", data = data_for_model)

```

Summary:

```{r}
summary(msupA2)
```

Because the method used to define a population appears to be important for these relationships, we conducted an additional analysis to simplify our analysis to only those species for which a single method was used to determine population clusters, and repeated the model presented above (evaluating a possible interaction between method and number of populations on indicator 2).

First, subset the data to only those taxa where a single method was used: 

```{r}
ind2_single_methods<-indicators_full %>% 
                      filter(!is.na(indicator2)) %>% 
                      filter(n_extant_populations<500) %>%  # doesn't make a difference in the test below, but useful for 
                      filter(defined_populations_simplified=="genetic_clusters" | 
                             defined_populations_simplified=="geographic_boundaries" |
                             defined_populations_simplified=="eco_biogeo_proxies" | 
                             defined_populations_simplified=="management_units" |
                             defined_populations_simplified=="dispersal_buffer")


# check number of methods
length(unique(ind2_single_methods$defined_populations_simplified))

# check n by method
table(ind2_single_methods$defined_populations_simplified)

# check n total
nrow(ind2_single_methods)

# re-level to use geographic boundaries as reference category for the analysis
ind2_single_methods$defined_populations_simplified<-relevel(as.factor(ind2_single_methods$defined_populations_simplified),
                                                       ref="geographic_boundaries")

 
```

Does the effect of "single" method on indicator2 depend on number of maintained pops?

```{r}
msupA3<-glmmTMB(indicator2 ~ n_extant_populations + defined_populations_simplified +        n_extant_populations*defined_populations_simplified + (1|country_assessment), family = "ordbeta", data = ind2_single_methods)

# summary
summary(msupA3)
```

Because we found a relationship between method and number of populations on indicator PM, and a relationship between species range and number of populations, we further tested whether the effect of method on indicator PM is moderated by species range. 


First filter data to consider only wide ranging and restricted categories (ie remove unknown due to small sampling size)

```{r stats indicator2 and range}

## Remove unknown
data<- indicators_averaged_one  %>%
                    filter(!is.na(indicator2_mean)) %>% 
                    filter(species_range !="unknown")

# summary of indicator
summary(data$indicator2_mean)

# re-level to use geographic boundaries as reference category for the analysis
data$defined_populations_simplified<-relevel(as.factor(data$defined_populations_simplified),
                                                       ref="geographic_boundaries")

# make sure species range is a factor
data$species_range<-as.factor(data$species_range)  

```

Run model: Does method still impact indicator2 if we control for species range?

```{r}

## + country
m.b3 <- glmmTMB(indicator2_mean ~ defined_populations_simplified + species_range + (1|country_assessment), family = "ordbeta", data = data)


# summary results
summary(m.b3)

```

Similarly to the effect of number of populations on indicator 2, we further tested whether there was an interaction between method and species range, i.e. to determine whether species range was only associated with indicator 2 for some methods.

```{r}
## run model 
m.b4 <- glmmTMB(indicator2_mean ~ defined_populations_simplified + species_range + defined_populations_simplified*species_range + (1|country_assessment), family = "ordbeta", data = data)


# summary results
summary(m.b4)
```



### (c) Proportion of populations with Ne>500 (indicator1) 

Our analysis of Ne indicator followed a parallel structure to our analysis of PM indicator. 

Plot Ne indicator by method to define pops.

```{r}
# Prepare data for plot with nice labels:
# sample size of TOTAL populations
sample_size <- indicators_full %>%
                    filter(!is.na(indicator1)) %>% 
                    filter(n_extant_populations<500) %>% 
                    group_by(defined_populations_nicenames) %>% summarize(num=n())

# custom axis
## new dataframe
df<-indicators_full %>% 
  filter(n_extant_populations<500) %>%
  filter(!is.na(indicator1)) %>% 
    # add sampling size 
  left_join(sample_size) %>%
  mutate(myaxis = paste0(defined_populations_nicenames, " (n= ", num, ")")) %>%
#myaxis needs levels in the same order than defined_populations_nicenames
  mutate(myaxis = factor(myaxis, 
                  levels=levels(as.factor(myaxis))[c(1,12,2:11,13)])) # reorders levels



## plot 
pc<- df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=myaxis, y=indicator1, color=defined_populations_nicenames,    
                                     fill=defined_populations_nicenames)) +
          geom_boxplot() + xlab("") + ylab("Proportion of populations within species with Ne>500") +
          geom_jitter(size=.4, width = 0.1, color="black") +

## Coloring by range 
psupB.1<- indicators_full %>%
  # filter outliers with too many pops and missing data

  filter(!is.na(n_extant_populations)) %>%

```

First we tested whether method used was associated with variation in indicator (figure c)

Prepare data for model (remove outliers and NA in desired variable) and check n:
```{r}
# remove missing data 
data_for_model<-indicators_full %>% 
                      filter(!is.na(indicator1)) %>%
                      filter(n_extant_populations<500) # doesn't make a difference in the test below, but useful for plots

# check n per method
table(data_for_model$defined_populations_simplified)

# total n
nrow(data_for_model)

# re-level to use geographic boundaries as reference category for the analysis
data_for_model$defined_populations_simplified<-relevel(as.factor(data_for_model$defined_populations_simplified),
                                                       ref="geographic_boundaries")

```

Run model asking: Does Ne indicator vary with method used? Controlling for variation in indicator among countries:  

```{r}
m.c1<-glmmTMB(indicator1 ~ defined_populations_simplified + (1|country_assessment), family = "ordbeta", data = data_for_model)
```

See results:
```{r}
summary(m.c1)
```
we next investigated whether the relationships between methods and the indicator were moderated by the role of number of populations and species range. Ie:

Does method still influence indicator1 if we control for number of populations?

```{r}
m.c2 <- glmmTMB(indicator1 ~ defined_populations_simplified + n_extant_populations + (1|country_assessment), family = "ordbeta", data = data_for_model)

summary(m.c2)
```

We then tested if there a relationship between number of maintained populations and indicator1, overall, and/or with some methods? (model associated to plot psupB)

Prepare data for model (remove outliers and NA in desired variable) and check n:
```{r}
# remove missing data 
data_for_model<-indicators_full %>% 
                      filter(!is.na(indicator1)) %>%
                      filter(!is.na(n_extant_populations)) %>%
                      filter(n_extant_populations<500) # doesn't make a difference in the test below, but useful for plots

# check number of methods
length(unique(data_for_model$defined_populations_simplified))

# check n per method
table(data_for_model$defined_populations_simplified)

# total n
nrow(data_for_model)

# re-level to use geographic boundaries as reference category for the analysis
data_for_model$defined_populations_simplified<-relevel(as.factor(data_for_model$defined_populations_simplified),
                                                       ref="geographic_boundaries")

```

Does the number of maintained pops alone affect the Ne indicator? (i.e. not controlling for method)
```{r}
msupB1<-glmmTMB(indicator1 ~ n_extant_populations + (1|country_assessment), family = "ordbeta", data= data_for_model)
```

Summary:
```{r}
summary(msupB1)
```


Does the effect of method depend on the number of populations? Or put another way, does the importance of number of populations also depend on method? 

```{r}
# run model
msupB2 <- glmmTMB(indicator1 ~ defined_populations_simplified + n_extant_populations + defined_populations_simplified*n_extant_populations + (1|country_assessment), family = "ordbeta", data = data_for_model)
```

Summary:

```{r}
summary(msupB2)
```


Because “what’s a population and how do you define them?” is such an important question, we can also test the effect of methods alone. First, subset the data to only those taxa where a single method was used: 

```{r}
ind1_single_methods<-indicators_full %>% 
                      filter(!is.na(indicator1)) %>% 
                      filter(n_extant_populations<500) %>%  # doesn't make a difference in the test below, but useful for 
                      filter(defined_populations_simplified=="genetic_clusters" | 
                             defined_populations_simplified=="geographic_boundaries" |
                             defined_populations_simplified=="eco_biogeo_proxies" | 
                             defined_populations_simplified=="management_units" |
                             defined_populations_simplified=="dispersal_buffer")


# check number of methods
length(unique(ind1_single_methods$defined_populations_simplified))

# check n by method
table(ind1_single_methods$defined_populations_simplified)

# check n total
nrow(ind1_single_methods)

# re-level to use geographic boundaries as reference category for the analysis
ind1_single_methods$defined_populations_simplified<-relevel(as.factor(ind1_single_methods$defined_populations_simplified),
                                                       ref="geographic_boundaries")

 
```

Run model:

```{r, }
# run model
msupB3 <- glmmTMB(indicator1 ~ n_extant_populations + defined_populations_simplified +        n_extant_populations*defined_populations_simplified + (1|country_assessment), family = "ordbeta", data = ind1_single_methods)
```

Summary:

```{r}
summary(msupB3)
```

Finally, we tested for associations between range type on Ne>500 indicator. 

First filter data to consider only wide ranging and restricted categories (ie remove unknown due to small sampling size)


```{r stats indicator1 and range}

## Remove unknown
data<- indicators_averaged_one  %>%
                    filter(!is.na(indicator1_mean)) %>% 
                    filter(species_range !="unknown")

# summary of indicator
summary(data$indicator1_mean)


# re-level to use geographic boundaries as reference category for the analysis
data$defined_populations_simplified<-relevel(as.factor(data$defined_populations_simplified),
                                                       ref="geographic_boundaries")

# make sure specis range is a factor
data$species_range<-as.factor(data$species_range)

```
  
  
Is there still an effect of method on indicator1 if we control for species range?

```{r}
## run model  + country
m.c3 <- glmmTMB(indicator1_mean ~ defined_populations_simplified + species_range + (1|country_assessment), family = "ordbeta", data = data)


# summary results
summary(m.c3)

```
  
Finally, we tested interactions between method and species range, to determine whether the effect of species range only applies when some methods are used.


Is the effect of method on Ne indicator moderated by species range?

```{r}
## run model 
m.c4 <- glmmTMB(indicator1_mean ~ defined_populations_simplified + species_range + defined_populations_simplified*species_range + (1|country_assessment), family = "ordbeta", data = data)


# summary results
summary(m.c4)
```

## Indicator values by taxonomic group

All the following plots and analyses consider the average of multiassessed species (variable _mean), so that they are shown only once. 

We also grouped taxa with small n (<5) into "others", according to the following table:

```{r}
table(indicators_averaged_one$taxonomic_group)
```

They are grouped along with "other" in a new category "others" in the new variable `taxonomic_group_simplified`:

```{r}
indicators_averaged_one <- indicators_averaged_one %>% 
                           ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(taxonomic_group_simplified = case_when(
                                       # if the taxon group is in the list of groups with small n change to "others"
                                       as.character(taxonomic_group) %!in% c("bryophyte", "fungus", "other") ~  as.character(taxonomic_group),
                                       TRUE ~ "others"))

# check:
table(indicators_averaged_one$taxonomic_group_simplified)
```

We also create a group of only 3 categories for animals, plants and others:

```{r}
# Define the grouping map
grouping_map <- c(
  "amphibian", "bird", "fish", "invertebrate", "mammal",
  "angiosperm", "gymnosperm", "reptile", "pteridophytes", "others"
)

# Create a new variable taxonomic_group_3
indicators_averaged_one <- indicators_averaged_one %>%
                            mutate(
                              taxonomic_group_3 = case_when(
                                taxonomic_group_simplified %in% grouping_map[1:5] ~ "animals",
                                taxonomic_group_simplified %in% grouping_map[6:9] ~ "plants",
                                taxonomic_group_simplified %in% grouping_map[10] ~ "others",
                                TRUE ~ NA_character_
                              )
                            )

# reorder levels
indicators_averaged_one$taxonomic_group_3<- factor(indicators_averaged_one$taxonomic_group_3, 
                                                  levels=c("animals", "plants", "others"))

### Main Figure 3: Single figure 4 panels for violin plots and histograms for both indicators by taxonomic group

```{r}
plot_grid(p2, hist_p2, 
          p1, hist_p1,
          ncol=2, align = "v", labels=c("A)", "B)", "C)", "D)"))

ggsave("Fig3.pdf", width = 37, height = 25  , units = "cm")
```

## Supplementary Figure S2: Values of indicator 1 and indicator 2 for multiassessed taxa (alternative assessments)

```{r}
#subset only with taxa assessed multiple times:
only_multi<-indicators_full %>% 
                          filter(multiassessment=="multiassessment") 
```

First, check how indicator 1 changes across the multiassessments.

```{r}
p1<-only_multi %>% 
  # Keep rows with different values in indicator1 within each taxon group
  group_by(taxon) %>%
  filter(n_distinct(indicator1) > 1) %>%
  # plot
  ggplot(aes(x=taxon, y=indicator1)) +
          geom_line(colour="darkgrey") + 
          geom_point(aes(color=country_assessment)) +
  xlab("") + ylab("Proportion of populations within species with Ne>500") +
  labs(color="country") +
  ylim(0, 1)+
  coord_flip() +
  theme_light() + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(face = "italic"),  panel.border = element_blank(), legend.position="right", text= element_text(size=13))
p1

```

Now check how Proportion of maintained populations (indicator 2) changes across the multiassessments.

```{r}
p2<-only_multi %>% 
  # Keep rows with different values in indicator1 within each taxon group
  group_by(taxon) %>%
  filter(n_distinct(indicator2) > 1) %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x=taxon, y=indicator2)) +
          geom_line(colour="darkgrey") + 
          geom_point(aes(color=country_assessment)) +
    scale_color_manual(values= scales::hue_pal()(4)[2:4]) + # last 3 colors to make them the same than the other plot
  xlab("") + ylab("Proportion of maintained populations within species") +
  labs(color="country") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_light() + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(face = "italic"), panel.border = element_blank(), legend.position="right", text= element_text(size=13))
p2
```

Plot together:
```{r}
plot_grid(p2, p1,  
          rel_heights = c(1.4, 0.8),
          ncol=1, labels=c("A)", "B)")) 

ggsave("FigS2.pdf", width = 20, height = 25  , units = "cm")
```



## Indicator 3 (number of species with genetic diversity monitoring)
Indicator 3 refers to the number (count) of taxa by country in which genetic monitoring is occurring. This is stored in the variable temp_gen_monitoring as a “yes/no” answer for each taxon.

```{r}
indicator3

# n taxa 
nrow(ind3_data_firstmulti)

# transform data to how ggsankey wants it

  xlab("")

ggsave("FigS9.pdf", width = 20, height = 18  , units = "cm")

```

```{r}

## Summary table of mean indicator values and n

The tables below show the indicator values and sampling size averaging them by country, taxonomic group, distribution type or IUCN global red list status. For this summary the mean of the multiassessed species was considering and counted as a single entry for the sampling size. 

Codes for indicator names:

- **PM.ind**: Proportion of Mantained populations indicator (indicator 2)
- **Ne.ind**: Proportion of populations where Ne>500 indicator (indicator 1)
- **Mon.ind**: Number of species where genetic diversity monitoring is taking place (indicator 3)

Codes for summary stats:

- **n**: sampling size (number of taxa assessed) without missing data
- **mean**: mean value for the indicator value
- **sd**: standar deviation for the indicator value

Summary stats by country:
```{r}
x<-indicators_averaged_one %>% 
                group_by(country_assessment) %>%
