In 2020, three genetic diversity indicators were proposed and discussed[1-4]:

* **Indicator 1:** the proportion of populations within species with a genetically effective size, Ne, greater than 500.

* **Indicator 2:** the proportion of populations within species which are maintained.

* **Indicator 3:** the number of species and populations being genetically monitored within a country


To facilitate and standardize data collection across different groups and countries, we have created an online data collection form using [Kobotoolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/), a guidance document and processing scripts to estimate the indicators based on the Kobo form output. These are available here:
