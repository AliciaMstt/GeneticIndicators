# README

In 2020, three genetic diversity indicators were proposed and discussed[1-4]:

* **Indicator 1:** the proportion of populations within species with a genetically effective size, Ne, greater than 500.

* **Indicator 2:** the proportion of populations within species which are maintained.

* **Indicator 3:** the number of species and populations being genetically monitored within a country


To facilitate and standardize data collection across different groups and countries, we have created an online data collection form using [Kobotoolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/), a guidance document and processing scripts to estimate the indicators based on the Kobo form output. These are available here:

### Koboform: 

Kobotoolbox is a free and open source tool for data collection. It allows to easily develop digital data collection forms that work on both mobile devices and web browsers. Data can be collected from different devices and people, and is accessible through the KoboToolbox interface. This data can then be downloaded into multiple formats for use in applications such as Excel, R, Phyton or GIS software.

The file [kobo_form.xlsx](https://github.com/AliciaMstt/GeneticIndicators/raw/main/kobo_form.xlsx) is the .xlsx version of the Kobo form we built for collecting the needed raw data to estimate de Genetic Diversity Indicators mentioned above, as well as . This can be deployed as a form in Kobotoolbox as follows:

1. Download the file [kobo_form.xlsx](https://github.com/AliciaMstt/GeneticIndicators/raw/main/kobo_form.xlsx) from this repository.
2. Import it to Kobotoolbox following [these instructions](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/new_form.html).

Check [Kobotoolbox documentation](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/welcome.html) for further details on how to deploy and use it to estimate 

You can see a **dummy example** of how the online form looks once it is deployed in Kobo here: XXXXXX. **Notice that this form is just an example and it should NOT be used to collect real data**
