### This R function takes as input the output of the Kobo form "International Genetic Indicator testing" 
### and reformat its in order to have the data in a dataframe useful for estimating 
### Genetic Diversity Indicator 1 (the proportion of populations within species with 
###                                a genetically effective size, Ne, greater than 500.)

  ### Arguments:
  ###
  
  # kobo_output = a data frame object read into R from the `.csv` file 
  # resulting from exporting the Kobotoolbox data from the form 
  # "International Genetic Indicator testing" wit the settings explaiend at
  # https://github.com/AliciaMstt/GeneticIndicators
  
  ### Needed libraries:  
  
  #  library(tidyr)
  #  library(dplyr)
  #  library(utile.tools)
  #  library(stringr)

  ### Get data
  kobo_output<-kobo_output
  
  ### Separate data 
  
    # create a variable with the full taxon name if this variable doesn't exist already
    # (raw kobo output doesn't include it, but it may exists in a "clean" version of the 
    # output if ran through the quality check pipeline)
